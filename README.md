# Smart-Home-with-a-Smart-remote
This is an ionic app which includes both home automation functions and a smart remote of an sony TV

This is the source code of our app which was build by Ionic3 with a firebase databse.
It contains some buttons to switch the electrical items in our home and TV field.
Inside the TV field we have to choose the TV model and for each TV brand it contains unique TV REMOTE with all features in typical remote.

When we change the channels by clicking buttons, the value get changed in database and as a result of that the tv channel get changed with the help of our IOT device which placed near to the tv. Because database is read by IOT device frequently.
This is very helpful when we are outside of our home. We dont need to stay close to the TV.

Other advantage is Parents get notified when their children watch tv, and they can monitor them and protect them by watching bad channels.

The main advantage of the remote is we can get statistics of most watched channels during a paticulr time by changes in databse. We can use an algorithm for that. There are no ways to find most watched channels among people. Some Channels make surveys among people to get the informations. Sometimes people say lies to get the gift which will be given by the channel. As a solution for that we came accross an idea to calculate most watched channels by using an algorithms.

This will be useful for the companies to publish their apps at correct time.
